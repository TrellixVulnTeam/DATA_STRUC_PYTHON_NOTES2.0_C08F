## **Overview**

### **What Are Graphs?**

Graphs are collections of related data. They’re like trees, except connections can be made from any node to any other node, even forming loops. By this definition, *all trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees.*

### **Components of Graphs**

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/134d2271d2ff5cedb2f05ede63326cb12f8253d2/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f456232536b68482e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/134d2271d2ff5cedb2f05ede63326cb12f8253d2/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f456232536b68482e6a7067)

We call the nodes in a graph **vertexes** (or **vertices** or **verts**), and we call the connections between the verts **edges**.

An edge denotes a relationship or linkage between the two verts.

### **What Graphs Represent**

Graphs can represent any multi-way relational data.

A graph could show a collection of cities and their linking roads.

It could show a collection of computers on a network.

It could show a population of people who know each other and [Kevin Bacon (Links to an external site.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon).

It could represent trade relationships between nations.

It could represent the money owed in an ongoing poker night amongst friends.

And so on.

### **Types of Graphs**

### **Directed and Undirected Graphs**

The nature of the relationship that we represent determines if we should use a directed or undirected graph. If we could describe the relationship as "one way", then a directed graph makes the most sense. For example, representing the owing of money to others (debt) with a directed graph would make sense.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a17434989386f6f18a16851b5aeb8bbf92a129eb/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f766677527244522e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a17434989386f6f18a16851b5aeb8bbf92a129eb/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f766677527244522e6a7067)

Directed graphs can also be bidirectional. For example, road maps are directed since all roads are one-way; however, most streets consist of lanes in both directions.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a6113174942b0d66c04a6e12bc67db2a8b8959d5/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6d386d4133676f2e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a6113174942b0d66c04a6e12bc67db2a8b8959d5/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6d386d4133676f2e6a7067)

If the relationship's nature is a mutual exchange, then an undirected graph makes the most sense. For example, we could use an undirected graph to represent users who have exchanged money in the past. Since an "exchange" relationship is always mutual, an **undirected** graph makes the most sense here.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6b782a86e1920d53411b88e1510c7efd0bed2bc2/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f534a4e3036776a2e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6b782a86e1920d53411b88e1510c7efd0bed2bc2/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f534a4e3036776a2e6a7067)

### **Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs**

If you can form a cycle (for example, follow the edges and arrive again at an already-visited vert), the graph is **cyclic**. For instance, in the image below, you can start at B and then follow the edges to C, E, D, and then back to B (which you’ve already visited).

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e23529f1bd2dfe3227dee64fe174252b0c310d1a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f58764d44616c302e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e23529f1bd2dfe3227dee64fe174252b0c310d1a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f58764d44616c302e6a7067)

_Note: any undirected graph is automatically cyclic since you can always travel back across the same edge._

If you cannot form a cycle (for example, you cannot arrive at an already-visited vert by following the edges), we call the graph **acyclic**. In the example below, no matter which vert you start at, you cannot follow edges in such a way that you can arrive at an already-visited vert.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/321029108b001c2f2c3ea86c775f6a87b8436d6d/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4c58416d376d762e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/321029108b001c2f2c3ea86c775f6a87b8436d6d/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4c58416d376d762e6a7067)

### **Weighted Graphs**

**Weighted graphs** have values associated with the edges. We call the specific values assigned to each edge **weights**.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/405834c88f7cd436bc69aebf9bc3f20072857d3e/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f726a4d6a716b332e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/405834c88f7cd436bc69aebf9bc3f20072857d3e/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f726a4d6a716b332e6a7067)

The weights represent different data in different graphs. In a graph representing road segments, the weights might represent the length of the road. The higher the total weight of a route on the graph, the longer the trip is. The weights can help decide which particular path we should choose when comparing all routes.

We can further modify weights. For example, if you were building a graph representing a map for bicycle routes, we could give roads with bad car traffic or very steep inclines unnaturally large weights. That way, a routing algorithm would be unlikely to take them. (This is how Google Maps avoids freeways when you ask it for walking directions.)

_Note: [Djikstra's Algorithm (Links to an external site.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) is a graph search variant that accounts for edge weights._

### **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**

A **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** is a directed graph with no cycles. In other words, we can order a DAG’s vertices linearly in such a way that every edge is directed from earlier to later in the sequence.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4a276dc53718bd990dd5a8e62e99352f28965f0e/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6e71684d37757a2e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4a276dc53718bd990dd5a8e62e99352f28965f0e/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6e71684d37757a2e6a7067)

A DAG has several applications. DAGs can model many different kinds of information. Below is a small list of possible applications:

- A spreadsheet where a vertex represents each cell and an edge for where one cell's formula uses another cell's value.
- The milestones and activities of largescale projects where a topological ordering can help optimize the projects' schedule to use as little time as possible.
- Collections of events and their influence on each other like family trees or version histories.

It is also notable that git uses a DAG to represent commits. A commit can have a child commit, or more than one child commit (in a branch). A child could come from one parent commit or two (in the case of a merge). But there’s no way to go back and form a repeating loop in the git commit hierarchy.

## **Follow Along**

Before you draw graphs on your own, let's draw some graphs together. For each graph, we will have a description.

### **Exercise 1**

_Draw an undirected graph of 8 verts._

Remember, from our definitions above that an undirected graph has bidirectional edges. So, we can draw eight verts and then connect them with solid lines (not arrows) anyway we see fit.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/de48eaaa53f7fead48f3d09e394f8b1342f7d226/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6d6964443358642e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/de48eaaa53f7fead48f3d09e394f8b1342f7d226/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6d6964443358642e6a7067)

### **Exercise 2**

_Draw a directed graph of 7 verts._

A directed graph has at least one edge that is *not* bidirectional. So, again, we can draw our seven verts and then connect them with edges. This time, we need to make sure that one of the edges is an arrow pointing in only one direction.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/53c2b80679e6731818f5bb72fecdf17579dd0f70/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f3870436f6568412e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/53c2b80679e6731818f5bb72fecdf17579dd0f70/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f3870436f6568412e6a7067)

### **Exercise 3**

_Draw a cyclic directed graph of 5 verts._

This drawing will be similar to one for Exercise 2 because it is a directed graph. However, in this graph, we also need to ensure that it has at least one cycle. Remember that a cycle is when you can follow the graph's edges and arrive at a vertex that you've already visited.

To draw this graph, we will draw our five verts and then draw our edges, making sure that we create at least one cycle.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8609287c7507ded66414ab2be7154d68436b82ac/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4a424f7572506e2e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8609287c7507ded66414ab2be7154d68436b82ac/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4a424f7572506e2e6a7067)

### **Exercise 4**

_Draw a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of 8 verts._

Again, this graph will be directed. The difference is that it will be acyclic—we can order a DAG’s vertices linearly so that every edge is directed from earlier to later in the sequence.

For this graph, we will draw our eight verts in a line from left to right. We will then draw our edges, making sure that the edges always point from left to right (earlier to later in the sequence).

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9f74a9565045797142f292f619840371fc04698/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4d4e4c5a6f6f482e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9f74a9565045797142f292f619840371fc04698/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4d4e4c5a6f6f482e6a7067)

## **Challenge**

Draw one graph for each of the descriptions below:

1. Undirected graph of 4 verts.
2. Directed graph of 5 verts.
3. Cyclic directed graph of 6 verts.
4. DAG of 7 verts.

# **Loosey–goosey graphs**

When we first started looking at non-linear structures, we learned about their most fundamental characteristic: that their data doesn’t follow an order — at least, not an obvious numerical one, like we see in arrays or linked lists. Trees, [as we learned](https://medium.com/basecs/how-to-not-be-stumped-by-trees-5f36208f68a7#.hzdufmviz), start with a root node, and might connect to other nodes, which means that could contain subtrees within them. Trees are defined by a certain set of rules: one root node may or may not connect to others, but ultimately, it all stems from one specific place. Some trees have even *more* specific rules, like [binary search trees](https://medium.com/basecs/leaf-it-up-to-binary-trees-11001aaf746d#.x8kftrftl), which can only ever have *two* links to *two* nodes at any given time.

But what if we did something kind of crazy and just…threw these rules out the window? Well, as it turns out, we totally *can* do that! It’s just that we wouldn’t be dealing with trees anymore — we’d be dealing with something called a **graph**.

# Trees are nothing more than restricted types of graphs, just with many more rules to follow . A tree will always be a graph, but not all graphs will be trees.

So, what is it that makes a tree different from the large umbrella of graphs?

Well, for one thing, a tree can only flow in one direction, from the root node to either leaf nodes or child nodes. A tree can also only have one-way connections — a child node can only have one parent, and a tree can’t have any loops, or cyclical links.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*rguQ2Y2Z920IYGkO0cHHtQ.jpeg?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*rguQ2Y2Z920IYGkO0cHHtQ.jpeg?q=20)

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*rguQ2Y2Z920IYGkO0cHHtQ.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*rguQ2Y2Z920IYGkO0cHHtQ.jpeg)

Tree data structures as compared to graph data structures

With graphs, all of these restrictions go straight out the window. Graphs don’t have any concept of a “root” node. And why would they? Nodes can be connected in any way possible, really. One node might be connected to five others! Graphs also don’t have any notion of “one-directional” flow — instead, they might have direction, or they might have no direction whatsoever. Or, to complicate matters further, they could have some links that have direction and others that don’t! But we won’t get into that today.

Let’s stick with the simple stuff to start.

# **Graphs with direction, and graphs without**

Okay, so we know that graphs pretty much break all the rules that we know. However, there is one characteristic that every graph *must* have: every graph always needs to have, at the very least, one single node. Just as how trees need at least one root node in order to be considered a “tree”, similarly, a graph needs at least a single node in order to be considered a “graph”. A graph with just one node is usually referred to as a **singleton graph**, although we won’t really be dealing with those.

Most of the graphs we’ll be dealing with are a bit more complex. But, don’t be worried — we won’t be diving into the *super complicated* graphs today. And trust me, some graphs really are complicated!

Instead, let’s look at the two types of graphs that are pretty easy to spot, and also pretty common in graph theory problems: directed graphs, and undirected graphs.

As we know, there are no real rules in the way that one node is connected to another node in a graph. Edges (sometimes referred to as *links*) can connect nodes in *any* way possible.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*sdUlnmnwMcPQljH52HiYBQ.jpeg?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*sdUlnmnwMcPQljH52HiYBQ.jpeg?q=20)

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*sdUlnmnwMcPQljH52HiYBQ.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*sdUlnmnwMcPQljH52HiYBQ.jpeg)

Edges can connect nodes in any way possible!

The different types of edges are pretty important when it comes to recognizing and defining graphs. In fact, that’s one of the biggest and most obvious differentiators between one graph and another: the types of edges that it has. For the most part (aside from one exception, which we won’t cover today), graphs can have two types of edges: a edge that has a direction or flow, and an edge that has no direction or flow. We refer to these as *directed* and *undirected* edges, respectfully.

In a **directed edge**, two nodes are connected in a very specific way. In the example below, node A connects to node B; there is only *one* way to travel between these two nodes — only one *direction* that we can go. It’s pretty common to refer to the node that we’re starting from as the *origin*, and the node that we’re traveling to **as the *destination*. In a directed edge, we can **only travel\*\* **from the origin to the destination**, and never the other way around.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*nXh55HVMJavGwzSB5jS_-Q.jpeg?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*nXh55HVMJavGwzSB5jS_-Q.jpeg?q=20)

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*nXh55HVMJavGwzSB5jS_-Q.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*nXh55HVMJavGwzSB5jS_-Q.jpeg)

Directed edges compared to undirected edges

However, it’s an entirely different story with undirected edges. In an **undirected edge**, the path that we can travel goes both ways. That is to say, the path between the two nodes is *bidirectional*, meaning that **the origin and destination nodes are not fixed**.

This differentiation is actually pretty important, because the edges in a graph determine what the graph is called. If all of the edges in a graph are *directed*, the graph is said to be a **directed graph**, also called **digraph\***.* If all of the edges in a graph are *undirected\*, the graph is said to be — you guessed it — an **undirected graph**! Go figure, right?

![https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*cS26jONjjQ5ACImJmHhtqg.jpeg?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*cS26jONjjQ5ACImJmHhtqg.jpeg?q=20)

Directed graphs as compared to undirected graphs

This is all very cool, but at this point, I want to know two things — where did all of this graph stuff *come from*, exactly? And…why should we care?

Let’s investigate.

# **Tread lightly: we’re in graph country now**

Computer science loves to borrow stuff. More specifically, it has borrowed a lot of concepts from logic and mathematics. As it turns out, this is the case with graphs.

Graph data structures as we know them to be computer science actually come from math, and the study of graphs, which is referred to as **graph theory**.

# In mathematics, graphs are a way to formally represent a network, which is basically just a collection of objects that are all interconnected.

As it turns out, when computer scientists applied graph theory to code (and ultimately implemented graphs as data structures), they didn’t change a whole lot. So, a lot of the terms that we use to describe and implement graphs are the exact terms that we’ll find in mathematical references to graph theory.

For example, in mathematical terms, we describe graphs as **ordered pairs**. Remember high school algebra, when we learned about *(x,y)* ordered pair coordinates? Similar deal here, with one difference: instead of *x* and *y*, the parts of a graph instead are: **_v_**, for *vertices*, and **_e_**, for its *edges*.

The formal, mathematical definition for a graph is just this: **G = (V, E)**. That’s it! Really. I promise.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*zAmHaDww1A31Esup-Rmr-w.jpeg?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*zAmHaDww1A31Esup-Rmr-w.jpeg?q=20)

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*zAmHaDww1A31Esup-Rmr-w.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*zAmHaDww1A31Esup-Rmr-w.jpeg)

A very brief introduction to graph theory

But hang on a second — what if our graph has more than one node and more than one edge! In fact…it will pretty much *always* have multiple edges if it has more than one node. How on earth does this definition work?

Well, it works because that ordered pair — *(V, E)* — is actually made up of **two** **objects**: a *set* of vertices, and a *set* of edges.

Okay, that makes more sense to me now. But it would be a whole lot clearer if I had an example and actually wrote out the definition of a graph! So we’ll do just that. In the example below, we have an undirected graph, with 8 vertices, and 11 edges.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/40/1*goT8sipQbDIoogV6Kc_3KA.jpeg?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/40/1*goT8sipQbDIoogV6Kc_3KA.jpeg?q=20)

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*goT8sipQbDIoogV6Kc_3KA.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*goT8sipQbDIoogV6Kc_3KA.jpeg)

Formally defining an undirected graph

So what’s going on here?

Well, we wrote out our ordered pair *(V, E)*, but because each of *those* items is an object, we had to write those out as well. We defined *V* as an *unordered* set of references to our 8 vertices. The “unordered” part is really important here, because remember, unlike trees, there is **no hierarchy of nodes**! Which means that we don’t need to order them, since order doesn’t matter here.

We also had to define *E* as an object, which contains a bunch of edge objects within it. Notice yet again that our edge objects are also *unordered*. Why might that be? Well, what type of graph is this? Is there any direction or flow? Is there a fixed sense of “origin” and “destination”?

Nope, there’s not! This is an *undirected* graph, which means that the edges are bidirectional and the origin node and destination node are *not* fixed. So, each of our edge objects are also **unordered pairs**.

This particularity, of course, leads us to wonder: what if this were a **directed** graph? Time for another example! Here’s a directed graph, with three vertices and three edges:

![https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ThD5bfLUyEx49s5S9qKKow.jpeg?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ThD5bfLUyEx49s5S9qKKow.jpeg?q=20)

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*ThD5bfLUyEx49s5S9qKKow.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*ThD5bfLUyEx49s5S9qKKow.jpeg)

Formally defining a directed graph

The way we define the vertices here doesn’t look any different, but let’s look more closely at our edge definition. Our edge objects in this case are *ordered* pairs, because direction actually matters in this case! Since we can only travel from the origin node to the destination node, our edges *must* be ordered, such that the origin node is the first of the two nodes in each of our edge definitions.

Cool, so that’s how we define graphs. But…when would we ever actually *use* graphs? Well, you probably used one today. You might just not know it yet! Time to change that.

# **Super social graphs**

Graphs are all around us, we just don’t always see them for what they are.

In fact, by the very act of reading this post, you are *literally on a graph right now.* The web is a massive graph structure! When we click between websites and navigate back and forth between URLs, we’re really just navigating through a graph. Sometimes those graphs have nodes with edges that are undirected — I can go back and forth from one webpage to another — and others that are directed — I can only go from webpage A to webpage B, and never the other way around.

But there’s an even better example that beautifully illustrates our daily interactions with graphs: social networks.

Facebook, a massive social network, is a type of graph. And if we think more about it actually functions, we start to better understand *how* we can define, and exactly what *type* of graph it is. On Facebook, if I add you as a friend, you must accept my request. It’s not possible for me to be your friend on the network without you also being mine. The relationship between two users (read: nodes or vertices in graph terms!) is *bidirectional*. There’s no concept of an “origin” and a “destination” node — instead, you’re my friend and I am yours.

Can you guess what type of graph Facebook is implemented as?

If you guessed *undirected graph*, then you’re right! Well done. Relationships are two-way, so if we were to define Facebook’s friend network as a graph, its edges would all end up being unordered pairs when we wrote them out.

Twitter, on the other hand, works very differently from Facebook. I can follow you, but you might not follow me back. Case in point: I follow Beyonce, but she definitely does not follow me back (sadly).

Twitter as a directed graph structure

We could represent Twitter as a *directed* graph. Each edge we create represents a *one-way* relationship. When you [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi), you create an edge in the graph with your account as the origin node, and my account as the destination node.

So what happens when I follow you back? Do I change the edge you created when you followed me? Does it suddenly become bidirectional? Well, no, because I could unfollow you at any given point. When I follow you *back* on Twitter, I create a second edge, with *my* account as the origin node and yours as the destination.

The same model applies to Medium, as well, which lets you follow and unfollow authors! In fact, this network model is *all over the place*. And all it is, once we abstract all the layers away, is a graph. And truly, what a powerful thing it is.

# **Resources**

Lots and lots of entire *books* have been written about graphs. I certainly didn’t cover enough information here to fill a book, but that doesn’t mean you can’t keep learning about graphs! Fill your mind with more graph theory awesomeness, starting with the great links below.

# Objective 02 - Represent a graph as an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix and compare and contrast the respective representations

## **Overview**

### **Graph Representations**

Two common ways to represent graphs in code are **adjacency lists** and **adjacency matrices**. Both of these options have strengths and weaknesses. When deciding on a graph implementation, it's essential to understand what type of data you will store and what operations you need to run on the graph.

Below is an example of how we would represent a graph with an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list. Notice how we represent the relationship between verts C and D when using each type.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ff694105bfdaea68ee3a73c75cf604ac8f020e1c/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7369476d7138582e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ff694105bfdaea68ee3a73c75cf604ac8f020e1c/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7369476d7138582e6a7067)

### **Adjacency List**

In an adjacency list, the graph stores a list of vertices. For each vertex, it holds a list of each connected vertex.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067)

Below is a representation of the graph above in Python:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {
                            "A": {"B"},
                            "B": {"C", "D"},
                            "C": {"E"},
                            "D": {"F", "G"},
                            "E": {"C"},
                            "F": {"C"},
                            "G": {"A", "F"}
                        }
```

Notice that this adjacency *list* doesn't use any lists. The `vertices` collection is a `dictionary` which lets us access each collection of edges in O(1) constant time. Because a `set` contains the edges, we can check for edges in O(1) constant time.

### **Adjacency Matrix**

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067)

Here is the representation of the graph above in an adjacency matrix:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [1,0,0,0,0,1,0]]
```

We represent this matrix as a two-dimensional array–a list of lists. With this implementation, we get the benefit of built-in edge weights. `0` denotes no relationship, but any other value represents an edge label or edge weight. The drawback is that we do not have a built-in association between the vertex values and their index.

In practice, implementing both the adjacency list and adjacency matrix would contain more information by including `Vertex` and `Edge` classes.

### **Tradeoffs**

Adjacency matrices and adjacency lists have strengths and weaknesses. Let's explore their tradeoffs by comparing their attributes and the efficiency of operations.

In all the following examples, we are using the following shorthand to denote the graph's properties:

[Untitled](D1%20512e148429ab4b6cab8faaa2e446204a/Untitled%20Database%2007e5f34c20d741cfa8ea859ff2c8f39b.csv)

---

### **Space Complexity**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(V^2)` space

Consider a dense graph where each vertex points to each other vertex. Here, the total number of edges will approach V^2. This fact means that regardless of whether you choose an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix, both will have a comparable space complexity. However, dictionaries and sets are less space-efficient than lists. So, for dense graphs (graphs with a high average number of edges per vertex), the adjacency matrix is more efficient because it uses lists instead of dictionaries and sets.

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(V+E)` space

Consider a sparse graph with 100 vertices and only one edge. An adjacency list would have to store all 100 vertices but only needs to keep track of that single edge. The adjacency matrix would need to store 100x100=10,000 connections, even though all but one would be 0.

_Takeaway: The worst-case storage of an adjacency list occurs when the graph is dense. The matrix and list representation have the same complexity (`O(V^2)`). However, for the general case, the list representation is usually more desirable. Also, since finding a vertex's neighbors is a common task, and adjacency lists make this operation more straightforward, it is most common to use adjacency lists to represent graphs._

---

### **Add Vertex**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(V)` time

For an adjacency matrix, we would need to add a new value to the end of each existing row and add a new row.

```python
for v in self.edges:
  self.edges[v].append(0)
v.append([0] * len(self.edges + 1))
```

for v in self.edges: self.edges[v].append(0)v.append([0] \* len(self.edges + 1))

Remember that with Python lists, appending to the end of a list is `O(1)` because of over-allocation of memory but can be `O(n)` when the over-allocated memory fills up. When this occurs, adding the vertex can be `O(V^2)`.

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)` time

Adding a vertex is simple in an adjacency list:

```python
self.vertices["H"] = set()
```

Adding a new key to a dictionary is a constant-time operation.

_Takeaway: Adding vertices is very inefficient for adjacency matrices but very efficient for adjacency lists._

---

### **Remove Vertex**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(V^2)`

Removing vertices is inefficient in both representations. In an adjacency matrix, we need to remove the removed vertex's row and then remove that column from each row. Removing an element from a list requires moving everything after that element over by one slot, which takes an average of `V/2` operations. Since we need to do that for every single row in our matrix, that results in `V^2` time complexity. We need to reduce each vertex index after our removed index by one as well, which doesn't add to our quadratic time complexity but adds extra operations.

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(V)`

We need to visit each vertex for an adjacency list and remove all edges pointing to our removed vertex. Removing elements from sets and dictionaries is an `O(1)` operation, resulting in an overall `O(V)` time complexity.

_Takeaway: Removing vertices is inefficient in both adjacency matrices and lists but more efficient in lists._

---

### **Add Edge**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Adding an edge in an adjacency matrix is simple:

```
self.edges[v1][v2] = 1
```

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Adding an edge in an adjacency list is simple:

```
self.vertices[v1].add(v2)
```

Both are constant-time operations.

_Takeaway: Adding edges to both adjacency matrices and lists is very efficient._

---

### **Remove Edge**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Removing an edge from an adjacency matrix is simple:

```python
self.edges[v1][v2] = 0
```

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Removing an edge from an adjacency list is simple:

```python
self.vertices[v1].remove(v2)
```

Both are constant-time operations.

_Takeaway: Removing edges from both adjacency matrices and lists is very efficient._

---

### **Find Edge**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Finding an edge in an adjacency matrix is simple:

```python
return self.edges[v1][v2] > 0
```

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Finding an edge in an adjacency list is simple:

```python
return v2 in self.vertices[v1]
```

Both are constant-time operations.

_Takeaway: Finding edges in both adjacency matrices and lists is very efficient._

---

### **Get All Edges from Vertex**

You can use several commands if you want to know all the edges originating from a particular vertex.

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(V)`

In an adjacency matrix, this is complicated. You would need to iterate through the entire row and populate a list based on the results:

```python
v_edges = []
for v2 in self.edges[v]:
    if self.edges[v][v2] > 0:
        v_edges.append(v2)
return v_edges
```

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

With an adjacency list, this is as simple as returning the value from the vertex dictionary:

```
return self.vertex[v]
```

_Takeaway: Fetching all edges is less efficient in an adjacency matrix than an adjacency list._

---

### **Summary**

Let's summarize all this complexity information in a table:

[Untitled](D1%20512e148429ab4b6cab8faaa2e446204a/Untitled%20Database%2087e62ea72c9144788e10e8765df4c244.csv)

In most practical use-cases, an adjacency list will be a better choice for representing a graph. However, it is also crucial that you be familiar with the matrix representation. Why? Because there are some dense graphs or weighted graphs that could have better space efficiency when represented by a matrix.

## **Follow Along**

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/335012587396b095af8f6a8f28e2d2aedb3d84d0/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f796931503441462e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/335012587396b095af8f6a8f28e2d2aedb3d84d0/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f796931503441462e6a7067)

Together, we will now use the graph shown in the picture above and represent it in both an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix.

### **Adjacency List**

First, the adjacency list:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {
                            "A": {"B": 1},
                            "B": {"C": 3, "D": 2},
                            "C": {},
                            "D": {},
                            "E": {"D": 1}
                        }
}
```

The difference between this implementation and the previous adjacency list is that this representation allows our edges to have weights.

### **Adjacency Matrix**

Now, we need to implement an adjacency matrix. Remember, that one benefit of the matrix is how easy it is to represent edge weights:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,3,2,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,1,0]]
```

## **Challenge**

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b6251eb484344b565ae2753682c645f85283ab28/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f634a366c656b4d2e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b6251eb484344b565ae2753682c645f85283ab28/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f634a366c656b4d2e6a7067)

1. Using the graph shown in the picture above, write python code to represent the graph in an adjacency list.
2. Using the same graph you used for the first exercise, write python code to represent the graph in an adjacency matrix.
3. Write a paragraph that compares and contrasts the efficiency of your different representations.

# Objective 03 - Implement user-defined Vertex and Graph classes that allow basic operations

## **Overview**

We will now use dictionaries to implement the graph abstract data type in Python. We need to have two classes. First, the `Graph` class that will keep track of the vertices in the graph instance. Second, the `Vertex` class, which we will use to represent each vertex contained in a graph. Both classes will have methods that allow you to complete the basic operations for interacting with graphs and vertices.

## **Follow Along**

### **The `Vertex` Class**

Let's start by defining a `Vertex` class and defining its initialization method (`__init__`) and its `__str__` method so we can print out a human-readable string representations of each vertex:

```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.connections = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value) + ' connections: ' + str([x.value for x in self.connections])
```

The next thing we need for our `Vertex` class is a way to other vertices that are connected and the `weight` of the connection edge. We will call this method `add_connection`.

```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.connections = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value) + ' connections: ' + str([x.value for x in self.connections])

    def add_connection(self, vert, weight = 0):
        self.connections[vert] = weight
```

Let's now add three methods that allow us to get data out of our `Vertex` instance objects. These three methods will be `get_connections` (retrieves all currently connected vertices), `get_value` (retrieves the value of the vertex instance), and `get_weight` (gets the edge weight from the vertex to a specified connected vertex).

```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.connections = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value) + ' connections: ' + str([x.value for x in self.connections])

    def add_connection(self, vert, weight = 0):
        self.connections[vert] = weight

    def get_connections(self):
        return self.connections.keys()

    def get_value(self):
        return self.value

    def get_weight(self, vert):
        return self.connections[vert]
```

We've finished our `Vertex` class. Now, let's work on our `Graph` class.

### **The `Graph` Class**

Our graph class's primary purpose is to be a way that we can map vertex names to specific vertex objects. We also want to keep track of the number of vertices that our graph contains using a `count` property. We will do so using a dictionary. Let's start by defining an initialization method (`__init__`).

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0
```

Next, we need a way to add vertices to our graph. Let's define an `add_vertex` method.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0

    def add_vertex(self, value):
        self.count += 1
        new_vert = Vertex(value)
        self.vertices[value] = new_vert
        return new_vert
```

We also need a way to add an edge to our graph. We need a method that can create a connection between two vertices and specify the edge's weight. Let's do so by defined an `add_edge` method.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0

    def add_vertex(self, value):
        self.count += 1
        new_vert = Vertex(value)
        self.vertices[value] = new_vert
        return new_vert

    def add_edge(self, v1, v2, weight = 0):
        if v1 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v1)
        if v2 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v2)
        self.vertices[v1].add_connection(self.vertices[v2], weight)
```

Next, we need a way to retrieve a list of all the vertices in our graph. We will define a method called `get_vertices`.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0

    def add_vertex(self, value):
        self.count += 1
        new_vert = Vertex(value)
        self.vertices[value] = new_vert
        return new_vert

    def add_edge(self, v1, v2, weight = 0):
        if v1 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v1)
        if v2 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v2)
        self.vertices[v1].add_connection(self.vertices[v2], weight)

    def get_vertices(self):
        return self.vertices.keys()
```

Last, we will override a few built-in methods (`__contains__` and `__iter__`) that are available on objects to make sure they work correctly with `Graph` instance objects.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0

    def __contains__(self, vert):
        return vert in self.vertices

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.vertices.values())

    def add_vertex(self, value):
        self.count += 1
        new_vert = Vertex(value)
        self.vertices[value] = new_vert
        return new_vert

    def add_edge(self, v1, v2, weight = 0):
        if v1 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v1)
        if v2 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v2)
        self.vertices[v1].add_connection(self.vertices[v2], weight)

    def get_vertices(self):
        return self.vertices.keys()
```

Let's go ahead and test our class definitions and build up a graph structure in a Python interactive environment.

```python
>>> g = Graph()
>>> for i in range(8):
...     g.add_vertex(i)
...
<__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183f5e0>
<__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183fdc0>

# **Loosey–goosey graphs**

When we first started looking at non-linear structures, we learned about their most fundamental characteristic: that their data doesn’t follow an order — at least, not an obvious numerical one, like we see in arrays or linked lists. Trees, [as we learned](https://medium.com/basecs/how-to-not-be-stumped-by-trees-5f36208f68a7#.hzdufmviz), start with a root node, and might connect to other nodes, which means that could contain subtrees within them. Trees are defined by a certain set of rules: one root node may or may not connect to others, but ultimately, it all stems from one specific place. Some trees have even *more* specific rules, like [binary search trees](https://medium.com/basecs/leaf-it-up-to-binary-trees-11001aaf746d#.x8kftrftl), which can only ever have *two* links to *two* nodes at any given time.

But what if we did something kind of crazy and just…threw these rules out the window? Well, as it turns out, we totally *can* do that! It’s just that we wouldn’t be dealing with trees anymore — we’d be dealing with something called a **graph**.

# Trees are nothing more than restricted types of graphs, just with many more rules to follow . A tree will always be a graph, but not all graphs will be trees.

So, what is it that makes a tree different from the large umbrella of graphs?

Well, for one thing, a tree can only flow in one direction, from the root node to either leaf nodes or child nodes. A tree can also only have one-way connections — a child node can only have one parent, and a tree can’t have any loops, or cyclical links.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*rguQ2Y2Z920IYGkO0cHHtQ.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*rguQ2Y2Z920IYGkO0cHHtQ.jpeg)

Tree data structures as compared to graph data structures

With graphs, all of these restrictions go straight out the window. Graphs don’t have any concept of a “root” node. And why would they? Nodes can be connected in any way possible, really. One node might be connected to five others! Graphs also don’t have any notion of “one-directional” flow — instead, they might have direction, or they might have no direction whatsoever. Or, to complicate matters further, they could have some links that have direction and others that don’t! But we won’t get into that today.

Let’s stick with the simple stuff to start.

# **Graphs with direction, and graphs without**

Okay, so we know that graphs pretty much break all the rules that we know. However, there is one characteristic that every graph *must* have: every graph always needs to have, at the very least, one single node. Just as how trees need at least one root node in order to be considered a “tree”, similarly, a graph needs at least a single node in order to be considered a “graph”. A graph with just one node is usually referred to as a **singleton graph**, although we won’t really be dealing with those.

Most of the graphs we’ll be dealing with are a bit more complex. But, don’t be worried — we won’t be diving into the *super complicated* graphs today. And trust me, some graphs really are complicated!

Instead, let’s look at the two types of graphs that are pretty easy to spot, and also pretty common in graph theory problems: directed graphs, and undirected graphs.

As we know, there are no real rules in the way that one node is connected to another node in a graph. Edges (sometimes referred to as *links*) can connect nodes in *any* way possible.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*sdUlnmnwMcPQljH52HiYBQ.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*sdUlnmnwMcPQljH52HiYBQ.jpeg)

Edges can connect nodes in any way possible!

The different types of edges are pretty important when it comes to recognizing and defining graphs. In fact, that’s one of the biggest and most obvious differentiators between one graph and another: the types of edges that it has. For the most part (aside from one exception, which we won’t cover today), graphs can have two types of edges: a edge that has a direction or flow, and an edge that has no direction or flow. We refer to these as *directed* and *undirected* edges, respectfully.

In a **directed edge**, two nodes are connected in a very specific way. In the example below, node A connects to node B; there is only *one* way to travel between these two nodes — only one *direction* that we can go. It’s pretty common to refer to the node that we’re starting from as the *origin*, and the node that we’re traveling to **as the *destination*. In a directed edge, we can **only travel\*\* **from the origin to the destination**, and never the other way around.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*nXh55HVMJavGwzSB5jS_-Q.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*nXh55HVMJavGwzSB5jS_-Q.jpeg)

Directed edges compared to undirected edges

However, it’s an entirely different story with undirected edges. In an **undirected edge**, the path that we can travel goes both ways. That is to say, the path between the two nodes is *bidirectional*, meaning that **the origin and destination nodes are not fixed**.

This differentiation is actually pretty important, because the edges in a graph determine what the graph is called. If all of the edges in a graph are *directed*, the graph is said to be a **directed graph**, also called **digraph\***.* If all of the edges in a graph are *undirected\*, the graph is said to be — you guessed it — an **undirected graph**! Go figure, right?

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*cS26jONjjQ5ACImJmHhtqg.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*cS26jONjjQ5ACImJmHhtqg.jpeg)

Directed graphs as compared to undirected graphs

This is all very cool, but at this point, I want to know two things — where did all of this graph stuff *come from*, exactly? And…why should we care?

Let’s investigate.

# **Tread lightly: we’re in graph country now**

Computer science loves to borrow stuff. More specifically, it has borrowed a lot of concepts from logic and mathematics. As it turns out, this is the case with graphs.

Graph data structures as we know them to be computer science actually come from math, and the study of graphs, which is referred to as **graph theory**.

# In mathematics, graphs are a way to formally represent a network, which is basically just a collection of objects that are all interconnected.

As it turns out, when computer scientists applied graph theory to code (and ultimately implemented graphs as data structures), they didn’t change a whole lot. So, a lot of the terms that we use to describe and implement graphs are the exact terms that we’ll find in mathematical references to graph theory.

For example, in mathematical terms, we describe graphs as **ordered pairs**. Remember high school algebra, when we learned about *(x,y)* ordered pair coordinates? Similar deal here, with one difference: instead of *x* and *y*, the parts of a graph instead are: **_v_**, for *vertices*, and **_e_**, for its *edges*.

The formal, mathematical definition for a graph is just this: **G = (V, E)**. That’s it! Really. I promise.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*zAmHaDww1A31Esup-Rmr-w.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*zAmHaDww1A31Esup-Rmr-w.jpeg)

A very brief introduction to graph theory

But hang on a second — what if our graph has more than one node and more than one edge! In fact…it will pretty much *always* have multiple edges if it has more than one node. How on earth does this definition work?

Well, it works because that ordered pair — *(V, E)* — is actually made up of **two** **objects**: a *set* of vertices, and a *set* of edges.

Okay, that makes more sense to me now. But it would be a whole lot clearer if I had an example and actually wrote out the definition of a graph! So we’ll do just that. In the example below, we have an undirected graph, with 8 vertices, and 11 edges.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*goT8sipQbDIoogV6Kc_3KA.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*goT8sipQbDIoogV6Kc_3KA.jpeg)

Formally defining an undirected graph

So what’s going on here?

Well, we wrote out our ordered pair *(V, E)*, but because each of *those* items is an object, we had to write those out as well. We defined *V* as an *unordered* set of references to our 8 vertices. The “unordered” part is really important here, because remember, unlike trees, there is **no hierarchy of nodes**! Which means that we don’t need to order them, since order doesn’t matter here.

We also had to define *E* as an object, which contains a bunch of edge objects within it. Notice yet again that our edge objects are also *unordered*. Why might that be? Well, what type of graph is this? Is there any direction or flow? Is there a fixed sense of “origin” and “destination”?

Nope, there’s not! This is an *undirected* graph, which means that the edges are bidirectional and the origin node and destination node are *not* fixed. So, each of our edge objects are also **unordered pairs**.

This particularity, of course, leads us to wonder: what if this were a **directed** graph? Time for another example! Here’s a directed graph, with three vertices and three edges:

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*ThD5bfLUyEx49s5S9qKKow.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*ThD5bfLUyEx49s5S9qKKow.jpeg)

Formally defining a directed graph

The way we define the vertices here doesn’t look any different, but let’s look more closely at our edge definition. Our edge objects in this case are *ordered* pairs, because direction actually matters in this case! Since we can only travel from the origin node to the destination node, our edges *must* be ordered, such that the origin node is the first of the two nodes in each of our edge definitions.

Cool, so that’s how we define graphs. But…when would we ever actually *use* graphs? Well, you probably used one today. You might just not know it yet! Time to change that.

# **Super social graphs**

Graphs are all around us, we just don’t always see them for what they are.

In fact, by the very act of reading this post, you are *literally on a graph right now.* The web is a massive graph structure! When we click between websites and navigate back and forth between URLs, we’re really just navigating through a graph. Sometimes those graphs have nodes with edges that are undirected — I can go back and forth from one webpage to another — and others that are directed — I can only go from webpage A to webpage B, and never the other way around.

But there’s an even better example that beautifully illustrates our daily interactions with graphs: social networks.

Facebook, a massive social network, is a type of graph. And if we think more about it actually functions, we start to better understand *how* we can define, and exactly what *type* of graph it is. On Facebook, if I add you as a friend, you must accept my request. It’s not possible for me to be your friend on the network without you also being mine. The relationship between two users (read: nodes or vertices in graph terms!) is *bidirectional*. There’s no concept of an “origin” and a “destination” node — instead, you’re my friend and I am yours.

Can you guess what type of graph Facebook is implemented as?

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*qxvZX-YRBsRrmM5ePvNAQA.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*qxvZX-YRBsRrmM5ePvNAQA.jpeg)

Facebook as an undirected graph structure

If you guessed *undirected graph*, then you’re right! Well done. Relationships are two-way, so if we were to define Facebook’s friend network as a graph, its edges would all end up being unordered pairs when we wrote them out.

Twitter, on the other hand, works very differently from Facebook. I can follow you, but you might not follow me back. Case in point: I follow Beyonce, but she definitely does not follow me back (sadly).

![https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*urJTrfWn8aZdhb9A-HXZVg.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1*urJTrfWn8aZdhb9A-HXZVg.jpeg)

Twitter as a directed graph structure

We could represent Twitter as a *directed* graph. Each edge we create represents a *one-way* relationship. When you [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi), you create an edge in the graph with your account as the origin node, and my account as the destination node.

So what happens when I follow you back? Do I change the edge you created when you followed me? Does it suddenly become bidirectional? Well, no, because I could unfollow you at any given point. When I follow you *back* on Twitter, I create a second edge, with *my* account as the origin node and yours as the destination.

The same model applies to Medium, as well, which lets you follow and unfollow authors! In fact, this network model is *all over the place*. And all it is, once we abstract all the layers away, is a graph. And truly, what a powerful thing it is.

# **Resources**

Lots and lots of entire *books* have been written about graphs. I certainly didn’t cover enough information here to fill a book, but that doesn’t mean you can’t keep learning about graphs! Fill your mind with more graph theory awesomeness, starting with the great links below.

# Objective 02 - Represent a graph as an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix and compare and contrast the respective representations

## **Overview**

### **Graph Representations**

Two common ways to represent graphs in code are **adjacency lists** and **adjacency matrices**. Both of these options have strengths and weaknesses. When deciding on a graph implementation, it's essential to understand what type of data you will store and what operations you need to run on the graph.

Below is an example of how we would represent a graph with an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list. Notice how we represent the relationship between verts C and D when using each type.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ff694105bfdaea68ee3a73c75cf604ac8f020e1c/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7369476d7138582e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ff694105bfdaea68ee3a73c75cf604ac8f020e1c/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7369476d7138582e6a7067)

### **Adjacency List**

In an adjacency list, the graph stores a list of vertices. For each vertex, it holds a list of each connected vertex.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067)

Below is a representation of the graph above in Python:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {
                            "A": {"B"},
                            "B": {"C", "D"},
                            "C": {"E"},
                            "D": {"F", "G"},
                            "E": {"C"},
                            "F": {"C"},
                            "G": {"A", "F"}
                        }
```

Notice that this adjacency *list* doesn't use any lists. The `vertices` collection is a `dictionary` which lets us access each collection of edges in O(1) constant time. Because a `set` contains the edges, we can check for edges in O(1) constant time.

### **Adjacency Matrix**

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067)

Here is the representation of the graph above in an adjacency matrix:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [1,0,0,0,0,1,0]]
```

We represent this matrix as a two-dimensional array–a list of lists. With this implementation, we get the benefit of built-in edge weights. `0` denotes no relationship, but any other value represents an edge label or edge weight. The drawback is that we do not have a built-in association between the vertex values and their index.

In practice, implementing both the adjacency list and adjacency matrix would contain more information by including `Vertex` and `Edge` classes.

### **Tradeoffs**

Adjacency matrices and adjacency lists have strengths and weaknesses. Let's explore their tradeoffs by comparing their attributes and the efficiency of operations.

In all the following examples, we are using the following shorthand to denote the graph's properties:

[Untitled](D1%20512e148429ab4b6cab8faaa2e446204a/Untitled%20Database%20fa89b0866c0c41f1b3a416c0f66ce217.csv)

---

### **Space Complexity**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(V^2)` space

Consider a dense graph where each vertex points to each other vertex. Here, the total number of edges will approach V^2. This fact means that regardless of whether you choose an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix, both will have a comparable space complexity. However, dictionaries and sets are less space-efficient than lists. So, for dense graphs (graphs with a high average number of edges per vertex), the adjacency matrix is more efficient because it uses lists instead of dictionaries and sets.

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(V+E)` space

Consider a sparse graph with 100 vertices and only one edge. An adjacency list would have to store all 100 vertices but only needs to keep track of that single edge. The adjacency matrix would need to store 100x100=10,000 connections, even though all but one would be 0.

_Takeaway: The worst-case storage of an adjacency list occurs when the graph is dense. The matrix and list representation have the same complexity (`O(V^2)`). However, for the general case, the list representation is usually more desirable. Also, since finding a vertex's neighbors is a common task, and adjacency lists make this operation more straightforward, it is most common to use adjacency lists to represent graphs._

---

### **Add Vertex**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(V)` time

For an adjacency matrix, we would need to add a new value to the end of each existing row and add a new row.

```python
for v in self.edges:
  self.edges[v].append(0)
v.append([0] * len(self.edges + 1))
```

for v in self.edges: self.edges[v].append(0)v.append([0] \* len(self.edges + 1))

Remember that with Python lists, appending to the end of a list is `O(1)` because of over-allocation of memory but can be `O(n)` when the over-allocated memory fills up. When this occurs, adding the vertex can be `O(V^2)`.

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)` time

Adding a vertex is simple in an adjacency list:

```python
self.vertices["H"] = set()
```

Adding a new key to a dictionary is a constant-time operation.

_Takeaway: Adding vertices is very inefficient for adjacency matrices but very efficient for adjacency lists._

---

### **Remove Vertex**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(V^2)`

Removing vertices is inefficient in both representations. In an adjacency matrix, we need to remove the removed vertex's row and then remove that column from each row. Removing an element from a list requires moving everything after that element over by one slot, which takes an average of `V/2` operations. Since we need to do that for every single row in our matrix, that results in `V^2` time complexity. We need to reduce each vertex index after our removed index by one as well, which doesn't add to our quadratic time complexity but adds extra operations.

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(V)`

We need to visit each vertex for an adjacency list and remove all edges pointing to our removed vertex. Removing elements from sets and dictionaries is an `O(1)` operation, resulting in an overall `O(V)` time complexity.

_Takeaway: Removing vertices is inefficient in both adjacency matrices and lists but more efficient in lists._

---

### **Add Edge**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Adding an edge in an adjacency matrix is simple:

```
self.edges[v1][v2] = 1
```

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Adding an edge in an adjacency list is simple:

```
self.vertices[v1].add(v2)
```

Both are constant-time operations.

_Takeaway: Adding edges to both adjacency matrices and lists is very efficient._

---

### **Remove Edge**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Removing an edge from an adjacency matrix is simple:

```
self.edges[v1][v2] = 0
```

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Removing an edge from an adjacency list is simple:

```
self.vertices[v1].remove(v2)
```

Both are constant-time operations.

_Takeaway: Removing edges from both adjacency matrices and lists is very efficient._

---

### **Find Edge**

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Finding an edge in an adjacency matrix is simple:

```
return self.edges[v1][v2] > 0
```

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Finding an edge in an adjacency list is simple:

```
return v2 in self.vertices[v1]
```

Both are constant-time operations.

_Takeaway: Finding edges in both adjacency matrices and lists is very efficient._

---

### **Get All Edges from Vertex**

You can use several commands if you want to know all the edges originating from a particular vertex.

### _Adjacency Matrix_

_Complexity_: `O(V)`

In an adjacency matrix, this is complicated. You would need to iterate through the entire row and populate a list based on the results:

```python
v_edges = []
for v2 in self.edges[v]:
    if self.edges[v][v2] > 0:
        v_edges.append(v2)
return v_edges
```

### _Adjacency List_

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

With an adjacency list, this is as simple as returning the value from the vertex dictionary:

```
return self.vertex[v]
```

_Takeaway: Fetching all edges is less efficient in an adjacency matrix than an adjacency list._

---

### **Summary**

Let's summarize all this complexity information in a table:

In most practical use-cases, an adjacency list will be a better choice for representing a graph. However, it is also crucial that you be familiar with the matrix representation. Why? Because there are some dense graphs or weighted graphs that could have better space efficiency when represented by a matrix.

Together, we will now use the graph shown in the picture above and represent it in both an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix.

### **Adjacency List**

First, the adjacency list:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {
                            "A": {"B": 1},
                            "B": {"C": 3, "D": 2},
                            "C": {},
                            "D": {},
                            "E": {"D": 1}
                        }
}
```

The difference between this implementation and the previous adjacency list is that this representation allows our edges to have weights.

### **Adjacency Matrix**

Now, we need to implement an adjacency matrix. Remember, that one benefit of the matrix is how easy it is to represent edge weights:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,3,2,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,1,0]]
```

1. Using the graph shown in the picture above, write python code to represent the graph in an adjacency list.
2. Using the same graph you used for the first exercise, write python code to represent the graph in an adjacency matrix.
3. Write a paragraph that compares and contrasts the efficiency of your different representations.

# Objective 03 - Implement user-defined Vertex and Graph classes that allow basic operations

## **Overview**

We will now use dictionaries to implement the graph abstract data type in Python. We need to have two classes. First, the `Graph` class that will keep track of the vertices in the graph instance. Second, the `Vertex` class, which we will use to represent each vertex contained in a graph. Both classes will have methods that allow you to complete the basic operations for interacting with graphs and vertices.

## **Follow Along**

### **The `Vertex` Class**

Let's start by defining a `Vertex` class and defining its initialization method (`__init__`) and its `__str__` method so we can print out a human-readable string representations of each vertex:

```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.connections = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value) + ' connections: ' + str([x.value for x in self.connections])
```

The next thing we need for our `Vertex` class is a way to other vertices that are connected and the `weight` of the connection edge. We will call this method `add_connection`.

```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.connections = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value) + ' connections: ' + str([x.value for x in self.connections])

    def add_connection(self, vert, weight = 0):
        self.connections[vert] = weight
```

Let's now add three methods that allow us to get data out of our `Vertex` instance objects. These three methods will be `get_connections` (retrieves all currently connected vertices), `get_value` (retrieves the value of the vertex instance), and `get_weight` (gets the edge weight from the vertex to a specified connected vertex).

```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.connections = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value) + ' connections: ' + str([x.value for x in self.connections])

    def add_connection(self, vert, weight = 0):
        self.connections[vert] = weight

    def get_connections(self):
        return self.connections.keys()

    def get_value(self):
        return self.value

    def get_weight(self, vert):
        return self.connections[vert]
```

We've finished our `Vertex` class. Now, let's work on our `Graph` class.

### **The `Graph` Class**

Our graph class's primary purpose is to be a way that we can map vertex names to specific vertex objects. We also want to keep track of the number of vertices that our graph contains using a `count` property. We will do so using a dictionary. Let's start by defining an initialization method (`__init__`).

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0
```

Next, we need a way to add vertices to our graph. Let's define an `add_vertex` method.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0

    def add_vertex(self, value):
        self.count += 1
        new_vert = Vertex(value)
        self.vertices[value] = new_vert
        return new_vert
```

We also need a way to add an edge to our graph. We need a method that can create a connection between two vertices and specify the edge's weight. Let's do so by defined an `add_edge` method.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0

    def add_vertex(self, value):
        self.count += 1
        new_vert = Vertex(value)
        self.vertices[value] = new_vert
        return new_vert

    def add_edge(self, v1, v2, weight = 0):
        if v1 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v1)
        if v2 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v2)
        self.vertices[v1].add_connection(self.vertices[v2], weight)
```

Next, we need a way to retrieve a list of all the vertices in our graph. We will define a method called `get_vertices`.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0

    def add_vertex(self, value):
        self.count += 1
        new_vert = Vertex(value)
        self.vertices[value] = new_vert
        return new_vert

    def add_edge(self, v1, v2, weight = 0):
        if v1 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v1)
        if v2 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v2)
        self.vertices[v1].add_connection(self.vertices[v2], weight)

    def get_vertices(self):
        return self.vertices.keys()
```

Last, we will override a few built-in methods (`__contains__` and `__iter__`) that are available on objects to make sure they work correctly with `Graph` instance objects.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {}
        self.count = 0

    def __contains__(self, vert):
        return vert in self.vertices

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.vertices.values())

    def add_vertex(self, value):
        self.count += 1
        new_vert = Vertex(value)
        self.vertices[value] = new_vert
        return new_vert

    def add_edge(self, v1, v2, weight = 0):
        if v1 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v1)
        if v2 not in self.vertices:
            self.add_vertex(v2)
        self.vertices[v1].add_connection(self.vertices[v2], weight)

    def get_vertices(self):
        return self.vertices.keys()
```

Let's go ahead and test our class definitions and build up a graph structure in a Python interactive environment.

```python
>>> g = Graph()
>>> for i in range(8):
...     g.add_vertex(i)
...
<__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183f5e0>
<__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183fdc0>

>>> g.vertices
{0: <__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183f5e0>, 1: <__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183fdc0>, 2: <__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183fe20>, 3: <__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183fb50>, 4: <__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183fee0>, 5: <__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183ff40>, 6: <__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183ffd0>, 7: <__main__.Vertex object at 0x7fd0f183ffa0>}
>>> g.add_edge(0,1,3)
>>> g.add_edge(0,7,2)
>>> g.add_edge(1,3,4)
>>> g.add_edge(2,2,1)
>>> g.add_edge(3,6,5)
>>> g.add_edge(4,0,2)
>>> g.add_edge(5,2,3)
>>> g.add_edge(5,3,1)
>>> g.add_edge(6,2,3)
>>> g.add_edge(7,1,4)
>>> for v in g:
...     for w in v.get_connections():
...         print("( %s, %s )" % (v.get_value(), w.get_value()))
...
( 0, 1 )
( 0, 7 )
( 1, 3 )
( 2, 2 )
( 3, 6 )
( 4, 0 )
( 5, 2 )
( 5, 3 )
( 6, 2 )
( 7, 1 )
>>>
