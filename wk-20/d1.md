## Objective 02 - Represent a graph as an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix and compare and contrast the respective representations

### Overview <a id="overview"></a>

#### Graph Representations <a id="graph-representations"></a>

Two common ways to represent graphs in code are **adjacency lists** and **adjacency matrices**. Both of these options have strengths and weaknesses. When deciding on a graph implementation, it's essential to understand what type of data you will store and what operations you need to run on the graph.

Below is an example of how we would represent a graph with an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list. Notice how we represent the relationship between verts C and D when using each type.

**Adjacency List**

In an adjacency list, the graph stores a list of vertices. For each vertex, it holds a list of each connected vertex.

Below is a representation of the graph above in Python:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {
                            "A": {"B"},
                            "B": {"C", "D"},
                            "C": {"E"},
                            "D": {"F", "G"},
                            "E": {"C"},
                            "F": {"C"},
                            "G": {"A", "F"}
                        }
```

Notice that this adjacency _list_ doesn't use any lists. The `vertices` collection is a `dictionary` which lets us access each collection of edges in O\(1\) constant time. Because a `set` contains the edges, we can check for edges in O\(1\) constant time.

**Adjacency Matrix**

![https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0e81024228bd0b1dd29f33c47b0896b7a978e911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476953746d4e682e6a7067)

Here is the representation of the graph above in an adjacency matrix:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [1,0,0,0,0,1,0]]
```

We represent this matrix as a two-dimensional arrayâ€“a list of lists. With this implementation, we get the benefit of built-in edge weights. `0` denotes no relationship, but any other value represents an edge label or edge weight. The drawback is that we do not have a built-in association between the vertex values and their index.

In practice, implementing both the adjacency list and adjacency matrix would contain more information by including `Vertex` and `Edge` classes.

#### Tradeoffs <a id="tradeoffs"></a>

Adjacency matrices and adjacency lists have strengths and weaknesses. Let's explore their tradeoffs by comparing their attributes and the efficiency of operations.

In all the following examples, we are using the following shorthand to denote the graph's properties:

| Shorthand | Property |
| :--- | :--- |
| V | Total number of vertices in the graph |
| E | Total number of edges in the graph |
| e | Average number of edges per vertex |

**Space Complexity**

**Adjacency Matrix**

_Complexity_: `O(V^2)` space

Consider a dense graph where each vertex points to each other vertex. Here, the total number of edges will approach V^2. This fact means that regardless of whether you choose an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix, both will have a comparable space complexity. However, dictionaries and sets are less space-efficient than lists. So, for dense graphs \(graphs with a high average number of edges per vertex\), the adjacency matrix is more efficient because it uses lists instead of dictionaries and sets.

**Adjacency List**

_Complexity_: `O(V+E)` space

Consider a sparse graph with 100 vertices and only one edge. An adjacency list would have to store all 100 vertices but only needs to keep track of that single edge. The adjacency matrix would need to store 100x100=10,000 connections, even though all but one would be 0.

_Takeaway: The worst-case storage of an adjacency list occurs when the graph is dense. The matrix and list representation have the same complexity \(`O(V^2)`\). However, for the general case, the list representation is usually more desirable. Also, since finding a vertex's neighbors is a common task, and adjacency lists make this operation more straightforward, it is most common to use adjacency lists to represent graphs._

**Add Vertex**

**Adjacency Matrix**

_Complexity_: `O(V)` time

For an adjacency matrix, we would need to add a new value to the end of each existing row and add a new row.

```text
for v in self.edges:
  self.edges[v].append(0)
v.append([0] * len(self.edges + 1))
```

for v in self.edges: self.edges\[v\].append\(0\)  
v.append\(\[0\] \* len\(self.edges + 1\)\)

Remember that with Python lists, appending to the end of a list is `O(1)` because of over-allocation of memory but can be `O(n)` when the over-allocated memory fills up. When this occurs, adding the vertex can be `O(V^2)`.

**Adjacency List**

_Complexity_: `O(1)` time

Adding a vertex is simple in an adjacency list:

```text
self.vertices["H"] = set()
```

Adding a new key to a dictionary is a constant-time operation.

_Takeaway: Adding vertices is very inefficient for adjacency matrices but very efficient for adjacency lists._

**Remove Vertex**

**Adjacency Matrix**

_Complexity_: `O(V^2)`

Removing vertices is inefficient in both representations. In an adjacency matrix, we need to remove the removed vertex's row and then remove that column from each row. Removing an element from a list requires moving everything after that element over by one slot, which takes an average of `V/2` operations. Since we need to do that for every single row in our matrix, that results in `V^2` time complexity. We need to reduce each vertex index after our removed index by one as well, which doesn't add to our quadratic time complexity but adds extra operations.

**Adjacency List**

_Complexity_: `O(V)`

We need to visit each vertex for an adjacency list and remove all edges pointing to our removed vertex. Removing elements from sets and dictionaries is an `O(1)` operation, resulting in an overall `O(V)` time complexity.

_Takeaway: Removing vertices is inefficient in both adjacency matrices and lists but more efficient in lists._

**Add Edge**

**Adjacency Matrix**

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Adding an edge in an adjacency matrix is simple:

```text
self.edges[v1][v2] = 1
```

**Adjacency List**

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Adding an edge in an adjacency list is simple:

```text
self.vertices[v1].add(v2)
```

Both are constant-time operations.

_Takeaway: Adding edges to both adjacency matrices and lists is very efficient._

**Remove Edge**

**Adjacency Matrix**

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Removing an edge from an adjacency matrix is simple:

```text
self.edges[v1][v2] = 0
```

**Adjacency List**

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Removing an edge from an adjacency list is simple:

```text
self.vertices[v1].remove(v2)
```

Both are constant-time operations.

_Takeaway: Removing edges from both adjacency matrices and lists is very efficient._

**Find Edge**

**Adjacency Matrix**

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Finding an edge in an adjacency matrix is simple:

```text
return self.edges[v1][v2] > 0
```

**Adjacency List**

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

Finding an edge in an adjacency list is simple:

```text
return v2 in self.vertices[v1]
```

Both are constant-time operations.

_Takeaway: Finding edges in both adjacency matrices and lists is very efficient._

**Get All Edges from Vertex**

You can use several commands if you want to know all the edges originating from a particular vertex.

**Adjacency Matrix**

_Complexity_: `O(V)`

In an adjacency matrix, this is complicated. You would need to iterate through the entire row and populate a list based on the results:

```python
v_edges = []
for v2 in self.edges[v]:
    if self.edges[v][v2] > 0:
        v_edges.append(v2)
return v_edges
```

**Adjacency List**

_Complexity_: `O(1)`

With an adjacency list, this is as simple as returning the value from the vertex dictionary:

```text
return self.vertex[v]
```

_Takeaway: Fetching all edges is less efficient in an adjacency matrix than an adjacency list._

**Summary**

Let's summarize all this complexity information in a table:

| type | Space | Add Vert | Remove Vert | Add Edge | Remove Edge | Find Edge | Get All Edges |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Matrix | O\(V^2\) | O\(V\) | O\(V^2\) | O\(1\) | O\(1\) | O\(1\) | O\(V\) |
| List | O\(V+E\) | O\(1\) | O\(V\) | O\(1\) | O\(1\) | O\(1\) | O\(1\) |

In most practical use-cases, an adjacency list will be a better choice for representing a graph. However, it is also crucial that you be familiar with the matrix representation. Why? Because there are some dense graphs or weighted graphs that could have better space efficiency when represented by a matrix.

Together, we will now use the graph shown in the picture above and represent it in both an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix.

#### Adjacency List <a id="adjacency-list-8"></a>

First, the adjacency list:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {
                            "A": {"B": 1},
                            "B": {"C": 3, "D": 2},
                            "C": {},
                            "D": {},
                            "E": {"D": 1}
                        }
}
```

The difference between this implementation and the previous adjacency list is that this representation allows our edges to have weights.

#### Adjacency Matrix <a id="adjacency-matrix-8"></a>

Now, we need to implement an adjacency matrix. Remember, that one benefit of the matrix is how easy it is to represent edge weights:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,3,2,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,1,0]]
```

1. Using the graph shown in the picture above, write python code to represent the graph in an adjacency list.
2. Using the same graph you used for the first exercise, write python code to represent the graph in an adjacency matrix.
3. Write a paragraph that compares and contrasts the efficiency of your different representations.
